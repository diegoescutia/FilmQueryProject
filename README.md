Every time the user retrieves a data set, the data will include a list of actors on the film and the language of the film.  

## Technology Used 
Java, mySQL, Terminal, MAMP, and a Database.

## Lesson Learned 
I learned how to establish a connection to a database. Developing Java code to interact with the database to retrieve items based on the customer's request.
